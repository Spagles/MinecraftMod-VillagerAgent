/**
 * A "point of interest" kind that a chunk may contain.
 *
 * <p>Chunk memory stores, per feature, <b>one bit</b> (present / absent) plus <b>one packed
 * representative position</b> (see {@link ChunkMemory#recordFeature}). It deliberately does
 * NOT store every matching block: remembering "there is farmland in this chunk, e.g. at
 * (3, 64, 11)" is enough for recall and navigation, while storing all 256 farmland blocks of
 * a farm chunk was pure waste. Exact, complete detail is re-acquired on arrival by the
 * frustum scan.
 *
 * <p>Ordinals are used for the bitmask and are persisted — <b>append new features at the
 * end</b>, never reorder. Max 32 entries (int bitmask).
